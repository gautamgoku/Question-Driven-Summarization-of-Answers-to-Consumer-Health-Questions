The hormones are given until children reach an acceptable height or until children do not grow more than 1 inch (about 2.5 centimeters) in a year. During the first year of treatment, children may grow up to 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12 centimeters), but individual responses vary. Children do not usually have side effects from growth hormone therapy, but some children develop idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and mild swelling of the limbs that usually resolves quickly (peripheral edema).

Some children may have a delay in tooth development or a delay in puberty. Other abnormalities may be present depending on the cause of the growth hormone deficiency.

Thus, doctors make the diagnosis based on a collection of findings. First, doctors measure the child's height and weight and plot the measurements on age-specific growth charts to determine whether they are growing too slowly. Then they often do x-rays of bones in the hand. Such x-rays can show if the bones are developing normally for the child's age.\n",
