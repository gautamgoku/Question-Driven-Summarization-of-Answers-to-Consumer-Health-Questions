With such a strong force of air, coughing is the body's mechanism for clearing the breathing passageways of unwanted irritants. In order for a cough to occur, several events need to take place in sequence. First, the vocal cords open widely, allowing additional air to pass through into the lungs. Then the epiglottis closes off the windpipe (larynx), and simultaneously, the abdominal and rib muscles contract, increasing the pressure behind the epiglottis.\n",

Doctors ask When the person started coughing up blood How long the coughing has been going on Whether anything specific triggers it (such as cold, exertion, or lying down) About how much blood is coughed up (such as streaks, a teaspoonful, or a cupful) Whether the person has other symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, chest pain, or leg pain Doctors determine whether blood was actually coughed (and not vomited or dripped down the back of the throat from a nosebleed).

Clinical description It is characterized by the same anomalies as those described after maternal treatment with the drug isotretinoin (a vitamin A analog used for treatment of acne): malformations of the face (small, malformed, or missing ears, micrognathia , cleft palate ), conotruncal heart defects, aortic arch anomalies, and central nervous system anomalies ( hydrocephalus and posterior fossa abnormalities). Etiology The etiology is unknown.\n",

            "Normally, the heartbeat starts in an area in the top chambers of the heart (atria). This area is the heart's pacemaker. It is called the sinoatrial node, sinus node or SA node. Its role is to keep the heart beat steady and regular. Sick sinus syndrome is a group of heart rhythm problems due to problems with the sinus node, such as: The heartbeat rate is too slow, called sinus bradycardia The heartbeat pauses or stops, called sinus pauses or sinus arrest Episodes of a fast heart rate Slow heart rhythms that alternate with fast heart rhythms, called bradycardia-tachycardia or \"tachy-brady syndrome\" Sick sinus syndrome most often occurs in people older than age 50.\n",

In children, heart surgery on the upper chambers is a common cause of sick sinus syndrome. Coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, and aortic and mitral valve diseases may occur with sick sinus syndrome. However, these diseases may have nothing to do with the syndrome.\n",

GERD is also common in adults. Stomach acid can irritate and sometimes damage the esophagus Sometimes stomach acid gets in your child's throat and down the windpipe Nearly all babies have reflux and spit up sometimes Babies with GERD may throw up, have problems eating or breathing, or be cranky Children may have chest or abdominal pain, or heartburn Doctors make changes to your child's diet and how you feed them, and prescribe acid-blocking medicine Most babies outgrow reflux by about 18 months\n",

            "Healthy infants have reflux for many reasons. The circular band of muscle at the junction of the esophagus and stomach (the lower esophageal sphincter) normally keeps stomach contents from entering the esophagus (see Overview of the Esophagus). In infants, this muscle may be underdeveloped, or it may relax at inappropriate times, allowing stomach contents to move backward (reflux) into the esophagus. Being held flat during feeding or lying down after feeding promotes reflux because gravity is no longer able to help keep material in the stomach from flowing back up the esophagus. Overfeeding and chronic lung diseases predispose infants to reflux because they increase pressure in the stomach.\n",

Breathing often makes a squeaky musical sound called wheezing. Asthma happens in attacks that come and go Exercise, stress, or breathing dust in the air can trigger asthma attacks You wheeze and feel short of breath during an asthma attack Asthma attacks vary from mild to severe to life threatening During an asthma attack, you can take medicine that quickly opens your airway To prevent asthma attacks, stay away from things that trigger your asthma Some people take medicine to help prevent attacks Inside the Lungs and Airways\n",

Such triggers include Allergens Infections Irritants Exercise (called exercise-induced asthma) Stress and anxiety Aspirin Many inhaled allergens, including pollens, particles from dust mites, body secretions from cockroaches, particles from feathers, and animal dander, can trigger an asthma attack. These allergens combine with immunoglobulin E (Ig. E, a type of antibody) on the surface of mast cells to trigger the release of asthma-causing chemicals.

All drugs sold in the United States must have shown convincing proof that they work before doctors are allowed to prescribe them. Thus, because they haven't been properly tested, alternative medicines can't be marketed as drugs.

Allergy testing is appropriate when there is a suspicion that some avoidable substance (for example, exposure to cat dander) is provoking attacks. Skin testing can help identify allergens that may trigger asthma symptoms. However, an allergic response to a skin test does not necessarily mean that the allergen being tested is causing the asthma.

For early-stage cancers of the windpipe (larynx) and prostate, the rate of cure is essentially the same with radiation therapy as with surgery. Sometimes, radiation therapy is combined with other forms of treatment. Certain kinds of chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy, and these drugs may be given with radiation treatments.
