Breast cancer often happens in the glands that make breast milk or in the milk ducts (tubes that carry milk from your milk-making glands to your nipples). Breast cancer kills more women than any cancer except lung cancer Men can get breast cancer too Knowing how your breasts normally look and feel can help you find breast cancer earlytalk to your doctor if one of your breasts looks or feels different If your mother, sister, or daughter has breast cancer, you may be more likely to get breast cancertalk to your doctor to see when you should get screened (tested) A mammogram, an x-ray of your breasts, is a common screening test to check for breast cancer in women who are older than age 40 or more likely to get breast cancer Treatment usually involves surgery and often includes radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone-blocking medicines\n",

About 5 to 10% of women with breast cancer have one of these gene mutations. If a woman has one of these mutations, her chances of developing breast cancer are high, possibly as high as 46 to 72% during her lifetime. However, if such a woman develops breast cancer, her chances of dying of breast cancer are not necessarily greater than those of any other woman with breast cancer.\n",

In many breast cancer cases, women discover the lump themselves. Such a lump may be cancer if it is a firm, distinctive thickening that appears in one breast but not the other. Usually, scattered lumpy changes in the breast, especially the upper outer region, are not cancerous and indicate fibrocystic changes.\n",

Doctors may suggest that these women have that breast removed before cancer develops. This procedure is called contralateral (opposite side) prophylactic (preventive) mastectomy. This preventive surgery may be appropriate for women with any of the following: A genetic mutation that increases the risk of developing breast cancer (BRCA1 or BRCA2) At least two close, usually first-degree relatives who have had breast or ovarian cancer Radiation therapy directed at the chest when women were under 30 years old Lobular carcinoma in situ (a noninvasive type) In women with lobular carcinoma in situ in one breast, invasive cancer is equally likely to develop in either breast.

These cancers are associated with somatic mutations in breast cells that are acquired during a person's lifetime, and they do not cluster in families. In hereditary breast cancer, the way that cancer risk is inherited depends on the gene involved. For example, mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person's chance of developing cancer. Although breast cancer is more common in women than in men, the mutated gene can be inherited from either the mother or the father.\n",

Women with certain BRCA gene mutations may be offered the option of having both ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after they no longer wish to bear children, even when no cancer is present. This approach eliminates the risk of ovarian cancer and reduces the risk of breast cancer.

If a woman has one of these mutations, her chances of developing breast cancer are high, possibly as high as 46 to 72% during her lifetime. However, if such a woman develops breast cancer, her chances of dying of breast cancer are not necessarily greater than those of any other woman with breast cancer.\n",

            "Breast cancer that has spread beyond the lymph nodes is rarely cured, but most women who have it live at least 2 years, and a few live 10 to 20 years. Treatment extends life only slightly but may relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. However, some treatments have troublesome side effects. Thus, deciding whether to be treated and, if so, which treatment to choose can be highly personal. Choice of therapy depends on the following: Whether the cancer has estrogen and progesterone receptors How long the cancer had been in remission before it spread How many organs and how many parts of the body the cancer has spread to (where the metastases are) Whether the woman is postmenopausal or still menstruating Most women are treated with chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs.\n",

Risks that you cannot change include Agethe risk rises as you get older Genestwo genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, greatly increase the risk. Women who have family members with breast or ovarian cancer may wish to be tested for the genes.
