            "For scanning, a radionuclide is used to label a substance that accumulates in a specific part of the body. Different substances are used depending on which part of the body is to be evaluated. A substance may accumulate because the body uses (metabolizes) it, as for the following: Iodine is used to make thyroid hormones and thus accumulates in the thyroid gland. Diphosphonate accumulates where bone is repairing or rebuilding itself. Or a substance may abnormally accumulate in a specific area, as for the following: Red blood cells accumulate in the intestine when the intestine is bleeding rapidly.\n",

Because the body metabolizes many of the substances (such as iodine) used to label the radionuclide, radionuclide scanning can sometimes provide information about how a tissue is functioning, as well as what it looks like. Various radionuclides are used to image different parts of the body or types of disorders, as for the following: Blood flow to the heart: Thallium is used to show blood flow through the arteries that carry blood to the heart. Thus, it can help doctors evaluate coronary artery disease. To determine how the heart functions when it is working hard, doctors sometimes use thallium during stress testing, usually by having the person walk or run on a treadmill.\n",

For example, with a lung scan, the dose is similar to that used in about 100 single-view chest x-rays. Other scans may involve more or less radiation. Radionuclide scanning can take hours to do because of the need to wait between injection and scan to give the radionuclide time to reach the target tissue. Radionuclide scanning images are not as precise as those of x-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and many other imaging studies.\n",

To be extensively excreted in urine, a drug or metabolite must be water soluble and must not be bound too tightly to proteins in the bloodstream. The acidity of urine, which is affected by diet, drugs, and kidney disorders, can affect the rate at which the kidneys excrete some drugs. In the treatment of poisoning with some drugs, the acidity of the urine is changed by giving antacids (such as sodium bicarbonate) or acidic substances (such as ammonium chloride) orally to speed up the excretion of the drug. The kidneys ability to excrete drugs also depends on Urine flow Blood flow through the kidneys The condition of the kidneys Kidney function can be impaired by many disorders (especially high blood pressure, diabetes, and recurring kidney infections), by exposure to high levels of toxic chemicals, and by age-related changes.\n",

            "Canavan disease is a gene-linked neurological disorder in which the brain degenerates into spongy tissue riddled with microscopic fluid-filled spaces. Canavan disease has been classified as one of a group of genetic disorders known as the leukodystrophies. Recent research has indicated that the cells in the brain responsible for making myelin sheaths, known as oligodendrocytes, cannot properly complete this critical developmental task. Myelin sheaths are the fatty covering that act as insulators around nerve fibers in the brain, as well as providing nutritional support for nerve cells. In Canavan disease, many oligodendrocytes do not mature and instead die, leaving nerve cell projections known as axons vulnerable and unable to properly function.\n",

In addition, children who have had rheumatic fever should be given drugs (typically penicillin) by mouth every day or by monthly injections into the muscle to help prevent another streptococcal infection. When antibiotics are given to people who do not yet have an infection, this preventive treatment is called prophylaxis. How long this preventive treatment should be continued is unclear. It depends on the severity of the disease and is usually continued for at least 5 years or until age 21 (whichever is longer).\n",
