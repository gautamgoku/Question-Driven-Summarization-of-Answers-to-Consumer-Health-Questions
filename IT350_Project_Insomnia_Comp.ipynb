Symptoms of insomnia include: Lying awake for a long time before you fall asleep Sleeping for only short periods Being awake for much of the night Feeling as if you haven't slept at all Waking up too early Your doctor will diagnose insomnia based on your medical and sleep histories and a physical exam.\n",

During sleep, people may move a lot and kick. Eventually, they cannot sleep at all. Later, mental function deteriorates and coordination is lost (called ataxia). The heart rate may become rapid, blood pressure may increase, and people may sweat profusely.\n",

The interview includes questions about a person's symptoms, past medical history (what disorders the person has had), drugs (prescribed, over-the-counter, and recreational, including alcohol and tobacco), allergies, and disorders that run in the family. Typically, people with a possible disorder affecting the kidneys or urinary tract are asked about the following: The amount, frequency, and timing of urination Whether urination is painful, burns, or produces blood Whether urine leakage occurs (urinary incontinence) Whether starting the urinary stream is difficult Whether it feels like the bladder does not empty completely Whether they have had previous urinary tract infections, medical procedures involving the urinary tract, or surgery Whether they have pain in the flank, side, lower back, or abdomen, or near the genitals (such as the groin or labia) The diet and timing and type of food and fluid intake (sometimes) For example, because some foods and drugs may change the urine's color, doctors may ask about the person's diet. A person who is waking up often during the night to urinate may be asked about the amount, type, and timing of liquids drunk. Doctors then examine the person.\n",

They may be done at about 11 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. Ultrasonography can help estimate the risk of Down syndrome and certain other chromosomal abnormalities.

When carbon dioxide levels are high, the brain stem signals the respiratory muscles to breathe deeper and faster to remove carbon dioxide through exhalation, and vice versa.

Normally, the brain stem is very sensitive to changes in the blood level of carbon dioxide (a by-product of metabolism). When carbon dioxide levels are high, the brain stem signals the respiratory muscles to breathe deeper and faster to remove carbon dioxide through exhalation, and vice versa. In central sleep apnea, the brain stem is less sensitive to changes in the carbon dioxide level. As a consequence, people who have central sleep apnea breathe less deeply and more slowly than normal.\n",

Doctors may measure the amount of oxygen in the blood by using a sensor placed on a finger or an earlobe (pulse oximetry) or by taking a sample of blood from an artery (arterial blood gas analysis) or from a vein.

The management goal is to ease symptoms and keep the person with FFI as comfortable as possible. 1 11 However research is ongoing and a number of potential treatments are being developed. 2 4 7 8 As of 2016, a number of treatments have had some success in slowing disease progression in animal models , including pentosan polysulfate, quinacrine (mepacrine), and amphotericin B. Sadly, the results have been less clear in clinical trials in humans. 8 In Italy, a clinical trial trying to prevent symptoms in people known to have the genetic changes for FFI but have not yet developed symptoms is underway using doxyclycline.\n",

            "Not getting 8 hours of sleep every night does not mean your health is at risk. Different people have different sleep needs. Some people do fine on 6 hours of sleep a night. Others only do well if they get 10 to 11 hours of sleep a night. Treatment often begins by reviewing any drugs or health problems that may be causing or worsen insomnia, such as: Enlarged prostate gland, causing men to wake up at night Pain or discomfort from muscle, joint, or nerve disorders You should also think about lifestyle and sleep habits that may affect your sleep.\n",
