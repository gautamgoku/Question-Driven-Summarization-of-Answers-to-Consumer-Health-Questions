Now it's mainly in warmer parts of the world such as: South America Central America and islands in the Caribbean Africa India and other parts of South Asia Middle East\n",

Malaria parasites live in the red blood cells of infected people When mosquitoes bite an infected person, they pick up the parasite The next person the mosquitoes bite can get infected Malaria parasites first go to your liver to mature and reproduce. Then the parasites go into your blood and reproduce inside your red blood cells. Eventually the red blood cells burst and release the parasites, which then infect more red blood cells If many red blood cells are destroyed, you can get a low blood count (anemia) The most dangerous form of malaria is called falciparum malaria. Falciparum malaria is especially dangerous because the infected red blood cells can clog up tiny blood vessels and cause organ damage.\n",

In falciparum malaria, infected red blood cells stick to the walls of small blood vessels and clog them, damaging many organsparticularly the brain (cerebral malaria), lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. In falciparum malaria, fluid can accumulate in the lungs and cause severe breathing problems. Damage to internal organs can cause blood pressure to fall, sometimes resulting in shock. Other symptoms of falciparum malaria include diarrhea, jaundice, and kidney failure.\n",

The progesterone produced by the corpus luteum does the following: Prepares the uterus in case an embryo is implanted Causes the endometrium to thicken, filling with fluids and nutrients to nourish a potential embryo Causes the mucus in the cervix to thicken, so that sperm or bacteria are less likely to enter the uterus Causes body temperature to increase slightly during the luteal phase and remain elevated until a menstrual period begins (this increase in temperature can be used to estimate whether ovulation has occurred) During most of the luteal phase, the estrogen level is high.

As a result, assembly of the pre-replication complex is impaired, which disrupts replication licensing; however, it is not clear how a reduction in replication licensing leads to Meier-Gorlin syndrome. Researchers speculate that such a reduction delays the cell division process, which slows growth of the bones and other tissues during development and may contribute to the features of the disorder.

For example, drugs used to treat high blood pressure are called antihypertensives (hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure), and drugs used to treat nausea are called antiemetics (emesis is the medical term for vomiting).

To be extensively excreted in urine, a drug or metabolite must be water soluble and must not be bound too tightly to proteins in the bloodstream. The acidity of urine, which is affected by diet, drugs, and kidney disorders, can affect the rate at which the kidneys excrete some drugs. In the treatment of poisoning with some drugs, the acidity of the urine is changed by giving antacids (such as sodium bicarbonate) or acidic substances (such as ammonium chloride) orally to speed up the excretion of the drug. The kidneys ability to excrete drugs also depends on Urine flow Blood flow through the kidneys The condition of the kidneys Kidney function can be impaired by many disorders (especially high blood pressure, diabetes, and recurring kidney infections), by exposure to high levels of toxic chemicals, and by age-related changes.\n",
