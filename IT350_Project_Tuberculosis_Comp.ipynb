            "Disseminated tuberculosis is a contagious mycobacterial infection in which mycobacteria have spread from the lungs to other parts of the body through the blood or lymph system. Tuberculosis (TB) infection can develop after breathing in droplets sprayed into the air from a cough or sneeze by someone infected with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium. The resulting lung infection is called primary TB. The usual site of TB is the lungs (pulmonary TB), but other organs can be involved. In the United States, most people with primary tuberculosis get better and have no further evidence of disease.\n",

            "\n",
            "Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but they can also damage other parts of the body. TB spreads through the air when a person with TB of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, or talks. If you have been exposed, you should go to your doctor for tests. You are more likely to get TB if you have a weak immune system.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Tuberculosis has 3 stages: Primary infection Latent infection Active disease In primary infection, the TB bacteria enter your lungs and sometimes spread to other parts of your body. Only a few people with primary infection get sick. In latent (\"latent\" means hidden) infection, the body's defenses (immune system) attack the TB bacteria and seal them off inside small clumps of scar tissue. Your body may eventually kill the bacteria, but the bacteria often stay alive and inactive for many years. About 5 to 10% of people with latent infection get active disease.\n",

Bacteria that resist treatment with antibiotics are causing more and more cases of tuberculosis (called drug-resistant tuberculosis). In 2016, an estimated 600,000 people developed tuberculosis that was resistant to rifampin (rifampicin). About 490,000 of these cases were also resistant to isoniazid and sometimes other drugs. Drug resistance is a serious concern because drug-resistant tuberculosis must be treated for a very long time.\n",
